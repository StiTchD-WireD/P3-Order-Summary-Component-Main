## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- getting more comfortable with mobile-first workflow
- using comments in the html file to plan the layout before creating css stylesheet.
- buttons
- flipping/mirroring an image
- flexbox seems to be better than grid for cards (I may just need more practice with grid).
- tested the difference between articles, sections and div. Div is more suitable for smaller projects.
- changing the cursor for :hover.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<button class="proceed">Proceed to Payment</button>
<button class="cancel">Cancel Order</button>
```
```css
.card-section > a:hover {
    cursor: pointer;
}
```

### Continued development

I'd like to practice using article and section more. My next project will be creating a recipe page.
- On reviewing feedback from front-end mentor, I will first do another card project with focus on using rem/em instead of pixels, and CSS min, max and clamp functions. 

### Useful resources

- any colour selector that can pick a colour and give hex values.
